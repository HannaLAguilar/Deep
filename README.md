## Projects

1. [Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/HannaLAguilar/Sentiment_analysis): build neural networks models to predict if reviews movie are positive or negative.

2. [Predicting bike sharing](https://github.com/HannaLAguilar/Predicting_bike_sharing): using a scratch neural networks to predict the number of bikeshare users on given day.

3. [Dog breed classifier](https://github.com/HannaLAguilar/Dog-_Identification_CNN): implement an image classifier for dog breeds using CNN.

4. TV Script Generation (LSTM) *currently working on* 

Others projects:

* [Concrete crack](https://github.com/HannaLAguilar/Concrete_Crack_Classification): implement an image classifier for concrete cracks data.

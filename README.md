## Projects

### Neural Network

* [Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/HannaLAguilar/Sentiment_analysis): implements a scratch neural network that is able to classify a movie review into negative or positive.

* [Predicting bike sharing](https://github.com/HannaLAguilar/Predicting_bike_sharing): use a scratch neural networks to predict the number of bikeshare users on given day.

3. [Dog breed classifier](https://github.com/HannaLAguilar/Dog-_Identification_CNN): implements an image classifier for dog breeds using CNN. 

4. [TV Script Generation](https://github.com/HannaLAguilar/TV_Script_RNN): train a Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM) to generate scripts in the style of dialogue from Seinfeld.

5. [Face Generation](https://github.com/HannaLAguilar/Face_generation): use a DCGAN on the CelebA dataset to generate images of new and realistic human faces.

5. [Deploying a Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/HannaLAguilar/Sentiment_analysis_Web): use AWS SageMaker to build a sentiment analysis web app to classify a movie review into negative or positive.

### Others projects:

* [Concrete crack](https://github.com/HannaLAguilar/Concrete_Crack_Classification): implements an image classifier for concrete cracks data.

# Deep Learning Udacity

I am currently pursuing a Deep Learning nanodegree program at Udacity. If you want to check what I've been doing you can look this repository [Deep learning path](https://github.com/HannaLAguilar/Deep_Learning_path).

Check the program --> [Udacity program](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101)

## Projects

1. [Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/HannaLAguilar/Sentiment_analysis): implements a neural network that is able to classify a movie review into negative or positive.

2. [Predicting bike sharing](https://github.com/HannaLAguilar/Predicting_bike_sharing): using a scratch neural networks to predict the number of bikeshare users on given day.

3. [Dog breed classifier](https://github.com/HannaLAguilar/Dog-_Identification_CNN): implements an image classifier for dog breeds using CNN. 

4. [TV Script Generation](https://github.com/HannaLAguilar/TV_Script_RNN): implements a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to generate scripts in the style of dialogue from Seinfeld.

5. [Face Generation](https://github.com/HannaLAguilar/Face_generation): use a DCGAN on the CelebA dataset to generate images of new and realistic human faces.

5. [Deploying a Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/HannaLAguilar/Sentiment_analysis_Web): using AWS SageMaker to build a sentiment analysis web app to classify a movie review into negative or positive.

Others projects:

* [Concrete crack](https://github.com/HannaLAguilar/Concrete_Crack_Classification): implements an image classifier for concrete cracks data.
